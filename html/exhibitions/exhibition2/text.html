              For his exhibition at the Serpentine, Huyghe began by selecting a set
              of images and descriptions and gave them to an individual. As this person 
              recreated these images in their mind, their brain activity was captured by 
              an fMRI scanner and the data produced was given to a deep neural network, 
              which attempted to reconstruct them, collaging together elements from its own bank of images.
              The thousands of attempts of the deep neural network to construct visual representations of 
              a human thought were presented here on large LED screens distributed throughout the gallery. 
              The rhythms and pauses within the succession of images were endlessly modified by conditions
              in the gallery; sensors detecting light, temperature and humidity levels, the presence of insects, 
              and the gaze of visitors produced a feedback loop.
              The conditions of the space were constantly changing and inflecting each other. A community of flies living
              in the central gallery created unrepeatable patterns on the domed ceiling as they emerged, grew and learned to fly;
              areas of the gallery walls were sanded down, and the dust from the paint of previous exhibitions was tracked across
              the floor as visitors entered and departed.
              Together, these elements made up an ecosystem that looped together human, animal and technological players. 
              Each of these players may be indifferent to the others, but could not help but affect what became visible
              on the screens as they entered, and after they left.
              'When what is made is not necessarily due to the artist as the only operator, the only one generating intentions
              and that instead it's an ensemble of intelligences, of entities biotic or abiotic, beyond human reach, and that the present
              situation has no duration, is not addressed to anyone, is indifferent, at that moment perhaps the ritual of the exhibition 
              can self-present.'' -Pierre Huyghe in conversation with Hans Ulrich Obrist, 2018
              'Huyghe is not interested in creating fictions, but new realities; the realities he has created have proved unsettlingly visionary.' -ArtReview
              The exhibition contained live flies. Steps were taken by the Serpentine Galleries, with advice and assistance from specialists, to ensure the
              utmost care of the flies included in this installation.
