                For the past two decades, Santiago Sierra has carried out provocative actions around 
                the world. Known for his politically and socially charged work, Sierra returns to Lisson Gallery London
                to debut a large-scale, site-specific installation that continues the artist's interest in borders and displacement.
                Titled Impenetrable Structure, the grid-like installation is constructed out of military razor wire, 
                similar to what is used to create security perimeters between countries and in war zones. The work fills the 
                entire gallery space of 27 Bell Street, entered by visitors only one at a time, creating an environment in which
                access is restricted or entirely denied. Fine Arts in Madrid, Sierra moved to Hamburg as a guest of the Hochschule
                für bildende Künste (HFBK). It was there that he first became enthralled with the serialised arrangements of industrial
                containers while wondering around the harbour area of the city and where he also encountered a large community of immigrants 
                and the mass displacement of foreigners for the first time. Influenced by the formal language of the Minimal and Conceptual
                art movements of the 1960s and '70s, Sierra then began making geometrical structures using industrial materials to comment
                on issues posed by the borders of nation-states, temporary settlements and military bases. Transporting these concepts to an exhibition
                context - whether for Space closed by corrugated metal, Lisson Gallery, London, September 2002 (2002), where Sierra shuttered the newly 
                opened Bell Street location of Lisson Gallery for three weeks, or at the Venice Biennale in 2003, where he built a cement wall across 
                the Spanish Pavilion to block all visitors except for Spaniards - provides an effective strategy for highlighting the issues of separation,
               polarisation and fear present in contemporary society. His latest work, shown for the first time as part of this exhibition, continues these
                themes and once again incorporates industrial materials found in defense technology to create a truly impenetrable structure.
