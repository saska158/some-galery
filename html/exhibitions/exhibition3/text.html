              The work strongly interacts with the architecture of the German Pavilion starting from the outside;
              guard dogs secluded into a large cage, thick shatterproof glass panes which close the entrance portico
              of the pavilion's neoclassic building, leaving only the possibility for the visitor to view into the main hall,
              the shifting of the main entrance on the pavilion's side, and finally the disquieting presence of human beings 
              sitting on the edge of the roof, anticipate a total artwork in which different formal and expressive layers and means
              -  from visual installation to music, from painting to live performance - overlap.
              What Anne Imhof stages into (and with) the pavilion space is the depiction of a tough and
             alienating reality in which individuals are constrained by physical, political, economical,
              and technological limitations. The hardness of the elements used, such as glass and steel, evokes that
             of the places in which power and money are managed these days; in glass, in particular, is made the most important
              alteration of the pavilion's architecture, namely the addition of a transparent raised platform, one meter over the pavement,
               which modifies the relationship between space and human presence.
